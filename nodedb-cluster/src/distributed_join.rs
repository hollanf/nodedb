//! Distributed join execution: broadcast and shuffle joins across cluster nodes.
//!
//! **Broadcast join**: Control Plane serializes the small side (< 8 MiB),
//! sends it to all relevant nodes via QUIC transport. Each node performs
//! a local hash join with its local large-side data.
//!
//! **Shuffle join**: each node scans its local data, hashes on the join key,
//! routes rows to the owning node via QUIC transport. The target node
//! performs a local hash join on the repartitioned data.
//!
//! Both strategies use Arrow IPC for zero-copy batched data movement.
