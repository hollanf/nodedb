# NodeDB

**A local-first, real-time, edge-to-cloud hybrid database for multi-modal workloads.**

NodeDB provides Vector, Graph, Document (schemaless + strict), Columnar (with Timeseries and Spatial profiles), Key-Value, and Full-Text Search engines in a single Rust binary. All engines share the same storage, memory, and query planner — cross-engine queries execute in one process with zero network hops.

## Engines

| Engine                                       | What it does                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Vector](docs/vectors.md)                    | HNSW index with SQ8/PQ/IVF-PQ quantization and adaptive bitmap filtering           |
| [Graph](docs/graph.md)                       | CSR adjacency index, 13 algorithms, Cypher-subset MATCH, GraphRAG fusion           |
| [Document](docs/documents.md)                | Schemaless (MessagePack + CRDT sync) or Strict (Binary Tuples, O(1) field access)  |
| [Columnar](docs/columnar.md)                 | Per-column compression (ALP, FastLanes, FSST), predicate pushdown, HTAP bridge     |
| [Timeseries](docs/timeseries.md)             | Columnar profile with ILP ingest, continuous aggregation, PromQL, 12 SQL functions |
| [Spatial](docs/spatial.md)                   | R\*-tree, geohash, H3, OGC predicates, hybrid spatial-vector search                |
| [Key-Value](docs/kv.md)                      | Hash-indexed O(1) lookups, TTL, secondary indexes, SQL-queryable                   |
| [Full-Text Search](docs/full-text-search.md) | BM25 + 15-language stemming + fuzzy + hybrid vector fusion                         |

## Architecture

NodeDB uses a three-plane hybrid execution model:

- **Control Plane** (Tokio + DataFusion) — SQL parsing, query planning, connection handling. `Send + Sync`.
- **Data Plane** (Thread-per-Core + io_uring) — Physical execution, storage I/O, SIMD math. `!Send`.
- **Event Plane** (Tokio, bounded event bus) — AFTER trigger dispatch, CDC change streams, cron scheduler, durable pub/sub, webhook delivery. Consumes events from the Data Plane and dispatches side effects back through the Control Plane.

The planes communicate only through bounded lock-free SPSC ring buffers. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for the full design.

## Deployment Modes

- **Origin (server)** — Full distributed database. Multi-Raft consensus, Thread-per-Core data plane with io_uring, PostgreSQL-compatible SQL over pgwire. Horizontal scaling with automatic shard balancing.
- **Origin (local)** — Same binary, single-node. No cluster overhead. Like running Postgres locally.
- **[NodeDB-Lite](docs/lite.md) (embedded)** — In-process library for phones, browsers (WASM), and desktops. All engines run locally with sub-millisecond reads. Offline-first with CRDT sync to Origin.

Application code is the same across all three modes — the `NodeDb` trait exposes identical methods whether backed by an in-process Lite engine or a remote Origin server.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Run single-node server
./target/release/nodedb

# Connect with the CLI
./target/release/ndb

# Or connect with psql
psql -h localhost -p 6432
```

```sql
-- Create a document collection and insert data
CREATE COLLECTION users TYPE document;
INSERT INTO users { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' };
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- Create a vector index and search
CREATE COLLECTION articles TYPE document;
CREATE VECTOR INDEX ON articles FIELDS embedding DIMENSION 384;
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE embedding <-> $query_vec LIMIT 10;
```

See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for a fuller walkthrough.

## Capabilities

**Programmability**

- **Stored Procedures** — `CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE` with `BEGIN...END` bodies. Full procedural SQL: `IF/ELSIF/ELSE`, `FOR`, `WHILE`, `LOOP`, `DECLARE`, `RETURN`. Execution budgets via `WITH (MAX_ITERATIONS, TIMEOUT)`. `SECURITY DEFINER` execution model.
- **User-Defined Functions** — `CREATE [OR REPLACE] FUNCTION` with SQL expression bodies or procedural `BEGIN...END` bodies. Volatility levels (`IMMUTABLE`, `STABLE`, `VOLATILE`). Expression UDFs inline directly into DataFusion query plans. `GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION`.
- **Triggers** — `CREATE TRIGGER` with `ASYNC` (default, Event Plane), `SYNC` (ACID, same transaction), and `DEFERRED` (at `COMMIT` time) execution modes.

**Real-Time**

- **CDC Change Streams** — `CREATE CHANGE STREAM` with consumer group offset tracking, webhook delivery (`WEBHOOK_URL`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`), and log compaction (`COMPACTION=key`). Consumer groups support `CREATE/DROP CONSUMER GROUP` and `COMMIT OFFSET`.
- **Durable Topics** — `CREATE TOPIC ... ON STREAM` for persistent pub/sub backed by change stream infrastructure.
- **Cron Scheduler** — `CREATE SCHEDULE ... CRON '...' AS BEGIN...END` for recurring SQL jobs.

## Operations

- **Backup/Restore** — `BACKUP TENANT <id> TO '<path>'` and `RESTORE TENANT <id> FROM '<path>'`. Encrypted (AES-256-GCM), serialized as MessagePack. `DRY RUN` mode for pre-restore validation.
- **Storage conversion** — `CONVERT COLLECTION <name> TO document|strict|kv` for live in-place storage mode migration.

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release           # Build all crates

## Status

NodeDB is pre-release. All engines are implemented and tested, but the system has not yet been deployed in production.

The only restriction is offering NodeDB itself as a hosted database service (DBaaS) or commercial database tooling; that requires a [commercial license](LICENSE.md).
