# NodeDB

**Eight database engines in a single Rust binary. One SQL dialect. Zero network hops between engines.**

NodeDB replaces the combination of PostgreSQL + pgvector + Redis + Neo4j + ClickHouse + Elasticsearch with a single process. Vector search, graph traversal, document storage, columnar analytics, timeseries, key-value, full-text search, and multi-dimensional arrays share the same storage, memory, and query planner.

## Why NodeDB

- **One binary, not seven services.** No inter-service networking, no schema drift between systems, no data synchronization pipelines. A graph query that feeds a vector search that filters by full-text relevance executes in one process.
- **PostgreSQL wire protocol.** Connect with `psql` or any PostgreSQL client library. Standard SQL with engine-specific extensions where SQL can't express the operation.
- **Edge to cloud.** The same engines run embedded on phones and browsers (NodeDB-Lite, WASM) with CRDT-based offline-first sync to the server.
- **Serious about performance.** Thread-per-Core data plane with io_uring, SIMD-accelerated distance functions, zero-copy MessagePack transport, per-column compression (ALP, FastLanes, FSST, Gorilla). See benchmarks below.

## Performance

**Timeseries ingest + query benchmark** — 10M rows, high-cardinality DNS telemetry (50K+ unique domain names). Single node, NVMe storage.

### Ingest

| Engine      | Rate         | Time         | Memory     | Disk         |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| **NodeDB**  | **93,450/s** | 107s         | **120 MB** | 2,217 MB     |
| TimescaleDB | 56,615/s     | 177s         | 963 MB     | 2,802 MB     |
| ClickHouse  | 53,905/s     | 186s         | 1,035 MB   | **1,647 MB** |
| InfluxDB    | 22,715/s     | 88s (2M cap) | 1,656 MB   | 982 MB       |

### Queries (ms, best of 3)

| Query                      | NodeDB  | ClickHouse | TimescaleDB | InfluxDB (2M) |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `COUNT(*)`                 | **<1**  | 1          | 423         | 13,110        |
| `WHERE qtype=A COUNT`      | 47      | **6**      | 347         | 5,297         |
| `WHERE rcode=SERVFAIL`     | 41      | **6**      | 334         | 1,048         |
| `GROUP BY qtype`           | 56      | **15**     | 597         | 12,426        |
| `GROUP BY rcode`           | 52      | **16**     | 604         | 13,183        |
| `GROUP BY cached+AVG`      | 120     | **33**     | 677         | 13,652        |
| `GROUP BY client_ip (10K)` | **141** | 157        | 660         | 14,301        |
| `GROUP BY qname (50K+)`    | 2,665   | **288**    | 3,644       | 16,720        |
| `time_bucket 1h`           | 101     | **30**     | 603         | --            |
| `time_bucket 5m+qtype`     | 138     | **99**     | 711         | --            |

NodeDB is not a specialized timeseries database, yet it ingests 1.65x faster than TimescaleDB and 1.73x faster than ClickHouse with 8x less memory. Query latency is competitive with ClickHouse on low-cardinality aggregations and within 3-5x on high-cardinality GROUP BY. This is the tradeoff of a general-purpose engine: you get one system instead of five, with performance that stays in the same ballpark as specialized tools.

## Deployment Modes

| Mode                | Use case                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Origin (server)** | Full distributed database. Multi-Raft, io_uring, pgwire. Horizontal scaling. |
| **Origin (local)**  | Same binary, single-node. No cluster overhead.                               |
| **NodeDB-Lite**     | Embedded library for phones, browsers, desktops. CRDT sync to Origin.        |

## NodeDB-Lite

All eight engines as an embedded library. Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, and browser (WASM, experimental).

- **Lite only** -- local-first apps that don't need a server. Vector search, graph, FTS, documents, arrays, all in-process with sub-ms reads.
- **Lite + Origin** -- offline-first with CRDT sync. Writes happen locally, deltas merge to Origin when online. Multiple devices converge regardless of order.
- **Same API** -- the `NodeDb` trait is identical across Lite and Origin. Switch between embedded and server without changing application code.

See [NodeDB-Lite](https://github.com/NodeDB-Lab/nodedb-lite) for platform details and sync configuration.

## Key Features

**Write-time validation** -- Typeguards enforce types, required fields, CHECK constraints, and DEFAULT/VALUE expressions on schemaless collections. Graduate to strict schema with `CONVERT COLLECTION x TO strict`.

**Bitemporal queries** -- System time (audit trail) and valid time (temporal semantics) across all engines. Query data as it existed in the past, or as it was valid on a past date. GDPR-compliant tile purge on array engine.

**Multi-dimensional arrays** -- Scientific computing with Z-order indexed tiles, tile-level compression, and bitemporal support. Combine with vector/graph/text in fused queries via cross-engine identity.

**Real-time** -- CDC change streams with consumer groups (~1-5ms latency). Streaming materialized views. Durable topics. Cron scheduler. LISTEN/NOTIFY. All powered by the Event Plane.

**Programmability** -- Stored procedures with `IF/FOR/WHILE/LOOP`. User-defined functions. Triggers (async, sync, deferred). `SECURITY DEFINER`.

**Security** -- RBAC with GRANT/REVOKE. Row-level security with `$auth.*` context across all engines. Hash-chained audit log. Multi-tenancy with per-tenant encryption. JWKS, mTLS, API keys.

**Six wire protocols** -- pgwire (PostgreSQL), HTTP/REST, WebSocket, RESP (Redis), ILP (InfluxDB line protocol), native MessagePack.

## Tools

- **[`ndb`](https://github.com/NodeDB-Lab/nodedb-cli)** -- Native CLI with TUI, syntax highlighting, and tab completion. Alternative to `psql`.
- **[NodeDB Studio](https://github.com/NodeDB-Lab/nodedb-studio)** -- GUI client for managing collections, browsing data, and monitoring. _(coming soon)_
- **[nodedb-bench](https://github.com/NodeDB-Lab/nodedb-bench)** -- Performance benchmarks against competing databases.

## Building from Source

For development or contributing:

cargo nextest run --all-features
```

## Release Status

NodeDB Origin is in **public beta** as of **v0.1.0 (2026-05-01)**. All eight engines are feature-complete and covered by tests. The wire protocols (pgwire, HTTP, native MessagePack, RESP, ILP, WebSocket) are stable — clients written against 0.1.0 will keep working through 1.0.

**v0.1.0 — Beta (today).** Build new products on it. The public surface (SQL dialect, wire protocols, configuration) is stable; expect internal changes (storage layout, on-disk format, replication internals) between minor releases. Patch and minor bumps will land as needed — if something requires a 0.2, we ship a 0.2. The two months between beta and 1.0 are deliberately for real workloads to surface edge cases we can't manufacture in-house.

**v1.0.0 — Production-ready (target: 2026-07-01).** What 1.0 guarantees:

- **API & SQL stability** — semver from 1.0 onward. No breaking SQL or client-API changes within a major.
- **Wire protocol stability** — pgwire, HTTP, native MessagePack, RESP, ILP, WebSocket frozen.
- **On-disk format stability** — no breaking migrations within 1.x. Forward-compatible upgrades only.
- **Cluster & Raft stability** — rolling upgrades supported within 1.x; no quorum-breaking changes.
- **Performance SLAs** — published p50/p99 targets per engine, regression-gated in CI.
- **Security audit** — third-party audit completed and findings remediated before 1.0 ships.
- **Storage, backup, and recovery** — fully exercised under fault injection, sustained load, and crash-restart cycles.

Pre-1.0 versions may change internals between releases — those changes are critical-path work (storage, backup, security, recovery) that has to be hardened in real production conditions before we put a stability stamp on it. The wire protocol and SQL surface won't break; everything underneath is fair game until 1.0.

> **Note:** This release track applies to **NodeDB Origin** (the server) only. [NodeDB-Lite](https://github.com/NodeDB-Lab/nodedb-lite), [`ndb` CLI](https://github.com/NodeDB-Lab/nodedb-cli), and [NodeDB Studio](https://github.com/NodeDB-Lab/nodedb-studio) are versioned independently on their own tracks.
