//! This is the *cluster-wide* wire format version, distinct from:
//! - `nodedb_cluster::wire::WIRE_VERSION` (the binary frame layout
//!   version of the `VShardEnvelope`),
//! - the RPC frame header version in
//!   `nodedb_cluster::rpc_codec::header` (a private constant of that
//!   module).
//!
//! Bump this when the SPSC bridge, WAL, or RPC payload schemas change
//! in a way that requires a coordinated upgrade. Readers MUST reject
//! messages stamped with a version other than their own.
