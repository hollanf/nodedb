//! Pre-validation: fast-reject before Raft round-trip.
//!
//! The full validation path is: agent delta → Raft proposal → leader validates
//! → commit or reject. This round-trip is expensive (network + consensus).
//!
//! Pre-validation offers an optional fast-reject: the Control Plane checks
//! the delta against the leader's current state BEFORE submitting to Raft.
//! If the delta would obviously fail (e.g., UNIQUE violation on a value that
//! already exists), it's rejected immediately — saving the Raft round-trip.
//!
//! Pre-validation is best-effort: it may have a stale view of the leader state,
//! so deltas that pass pre-validation might still fail at commit time. But
//! deltas that fail pre-validation would definitely fail at commit time.
