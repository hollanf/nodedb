//! # nodedb-crdt
//!
//! CRDT engine with SQL constraint validation for NodeDB.
//!
//! ## The CRDT / SQL Paradox
//!
//! CRDTs are AP (Available + Partition-tolerant): agents compute optimistic
//! deltas offline and sync later. SQL constraints are CP (Consistent +
//! Partition-tolerant): UNIQUE indexes, foreign keys, etc. must hold globally.
//!
//! This crate bridges the gap:
//!
//! 1. **Optimistic local writes** — agents apply deltas to their local `LoroDoc`
//!    without constraint checks (AP behavior for availability).
//! 2. **Constraint validation at commit** — when deltas sync to the leader,
//!    constraints are validated against the committed state.
//! 3. **Dead-letter queue** — rejected deltas are routed to a DLQ with
//!    compensation hints so the application can recover gracefully.
//! 4. **Pre-validation** — optional fast-reject against the leader's state
//!    before the full Raft round-trip, reducing wasted consensus bandwidth.

/// Authentication context threaded through CRDT validation.
///
/// Carries the identity of who submitted the delta so the DLQ and deferred
/// queue can attribute entries to the correct user/tenant.
///
/// ## Replay protection
///
/// `device_id` and `seq_no` close the replay vulnerability: a captured
/// delta cannot be resubmitted because `seq_no` must be strictly greater
/// than `last_seen[(user_id, device_id)]` on the server. The HMAC input
/// binds the seq_no and device_id so they cannot be altered after signing.
///
/// ## Wire compatibility
///
/// Both `device_id` and `seq_no` have `#[msgpack(default)]` so that old
/// clients (pre-T4-D) that don't send these fields will deserialize with
/// 0/0. Note: seq_no=0 is never accepted (must be > last_seen=0), so old
/// unsigned deltas will be rejected unless the caller sets delta_signature
/// to all-zeros (unsigned path, which bypasses the replay check).
