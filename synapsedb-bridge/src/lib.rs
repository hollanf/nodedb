//! # synapsedb-bridge
//!
//! Lock-free, capacity-bounded SPSC ring buffer bridging a **Tokio Control Plane**
//! (`Send + Sync`) and a **Thread-per-Core Data Plane** (`!Send`).
//!
//! This crate is the single most critical infrastructure component in SynapseDB.
//! If this bridge fails under load, the entire database fails.
//!
//! ## Design constraints
//!
//! - **No locks, no atomics in the hot path** beyond the two cache-line-padded
//!   head/tail counters (one written by producer, one by consumer).
//! - **Bounded capacity**: the ring buffer has a fixed power-of-two slot count.
//!   When full, the producer must yield — this is the backpressure mechanism.
//! - **Cross-runtime waker integration**: when the queue transitions from
//!   full→not-full or empty→not-empty, the sleeping side must be woken
//!   *without* requiring `Send` on the waker itself.
//! - **Zero-copy where possible**: payloads are `Arc<[u8]>` or slab handles;
//!   the ring buffer moves lightweight envelopes, not bulk data.
//!
//! ## Validation target
//!
//! Pump 50 GB of dummy data Tokio→TPC→Tokio. Memory must stay flat.
//! Throughput must exceed 5 GB/s on a modern x86_64 machine.
