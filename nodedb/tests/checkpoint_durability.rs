//! Per-engine checkpoint writes must be durable across power loss.
//!
//! Each checkpoint writer uses the tmp-file + rename pattern for atomicity, but
//! on ext4 / XFS the rename metadata can reach disk before the data pages
//! backing the tmp file. A power loss between the write and the next checkpoint
//! then leaves a correctly-named file containing zeros, which is load-unsafe.
//!
//! `nodedb-wal::segment::roll_segment` already gets this right via `fsync` of
//! both the file and its parent directory. The checkpoint writers must use the
//! same pattern — exposed as a shared helper `nodedb_wal::segment::atomic_write_fsync`
//! — so the invariant is enforced in one place and cannot drift per call site.
//!
//! These tests are lint-style regression guards: they fail if any checkpoint
//! writer drops back to the non-durable `fs::write` + `fs::rename` pair. They
//! pass once every writer routes through the shared helper.
