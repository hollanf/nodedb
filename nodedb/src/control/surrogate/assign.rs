//! CP-side helper that turns a `(collection, pk_bytes)` into a stable

//! returning the persisted value on every subsequent call (UPSERT
//! preserves the surrogate).
//!
//! Cross-cutting flush trigger: every successful allocation runs the
//! registry's `should_flush()` check; if true, we persist the new
//! high-watermark to both the catalog row (`_system.surrogate_hwm`)
//! and the WAL (`SurrogateAlloc` record) before returning. The two
//! writes form one logical checkpoint — if either fails we surface
//! the error to the caller rather than silently letting the registry
