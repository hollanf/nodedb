//! Central shutdown coordination: one watch, one registry, one
//! spawn helper. Replaces the ad-hoc `_shutdown_senders: Vec<_>`
//! graveyard that carried no join handles, no laggard detection,
//! and no per-loop names.
//!
//! Every long-running background loop in the Control Plane and
//! Event Plane MUST spawn via [`spawn_loop`] / [`spawn_blocking_loop`]
//! and subscribe to the canonical [`ShutdownWatch`] held on
//! `SharedState`. On `main.rs`'s ctrl-c path, the watch is
//! signaled and [`LoopRegistry::shutdown_all`] awaits every
//! registered handle with a shared deadline, aborting async
//! laggards and logging blocking laggards.
