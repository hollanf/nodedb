//! Deterministic lock manager for the Calvin scheduler.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The lock manager provides a deterministic, totally-ordered lock table over
//! per-key entries keyed by [`LockKey`].  All locks are exclusive — every key
//! in a transaction's `read_set ∪ write_set` is acquired as an exclusive (write)
//! lock.
//!
//! # Why write-locks-only
//!
//! Deterministic single-threaded-per-vshard execution makes shared read locks
//! unnecessary.  Calvin guarantees that every replica applies transactions in the
//! same global order.  Because there is only one execution thread per vshard,
//! there is no concurrent reader that shared locks would need to permit.  Adding
//! shared read locks would complicate the waiter queue without providing any
//! throughput benefit.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! `BTreeMap` is used throughout (not `HashMap`) so that iteration order is
//! deterministic and reproducible across replicas.  This is a correctness
//! requirement, not a style preference.
