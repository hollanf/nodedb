//! WAL change notification bus.
//!
//! Tails the WAL and broadcasts committed mutations to subscribers on
//! the Control Plane. This is the foundation for:
//!
//! - Live queries: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending'` pushes
//!   changes in real-time to connected WebSocket clients.
//! - Phase 5 Shape evaluator: evaluates CRDT mutations against client shapes
//!   and pushes matching deltas.
//! - LISTEN/NOTIFY: PostgreSQL-compatible async notifications.
//!
//! The bus is a broadcast channel: each subscriber gets all mutations.
//! Subscribers can filter by collection/tenant on their end.
